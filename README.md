# Train Schedule

The train schedule uses Moment.js to provide users with information about when the next train will arrive based on the information they enter into the user input section. When a user enters information about their train, it will appear on the schedule with the name of the train, the destination, how often the train comes, what time the next train will arrive, and how many minutes until the train arrives. The train schedule is stored in Firebase, allowing the user to come back at a later point and check on their trains!
